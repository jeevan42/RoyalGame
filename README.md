### Welcome to our decentralized application (dapp), where you can participate in an exciting prediction game! Here's how it works:

- **Club Creation:** Any member can create a club. When creating a club, we fetch the current ETH/USD price from ChainLink and save it securely on the blockchain.

- **Club Opening:** The club is open for 2 minutes, during which interested players can join and participate.

- **Prediction Proposal:** Before the game deadline, players must propose the price they predict for a certain event. The game is open for 5 minutes.

- **Guessing Game:** Players choose a number between 50 and 100. This number is then combined with the data feed fetched from ChainLink.

- **Reveal and Reward:** At the end of the game, the smart contract reveals the combined data feed (summed with a random number). If a player's prediction matches or is closest to the revealed number, they win the full prize from the club pool.


 ## Note: The user have to  deposit some eth to  the club pool before craeting the proposal


## ChainLink

## What Next for Royal?

- ChainLink automation: I can use chainLink automation as well for the funds distribution to the winner but due to the lack of time I can't
- ChainLink function: I can use ChainLink function to  check for the genuine users and avoid spams proposal


## Challenges  I faced 

-   while fetching the price feed and combining this with the dapp  throws me lots of errors like price is  not fteched properly and state chnange.

## Restrictions

The Royal smart contract has some restrictions:

- Up to 99 members per club (in many jurisdictions, such as the USA and Chile, this is the maximum limit of club members for certain purposes and types of clubs).
- Only members can participate in club instances.
- Only members who contribute funds to a club have the right to create proposals.
